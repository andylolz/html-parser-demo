Two women have become one of the first same-sex partnerships to receive a blessing at a Church of England service. Prayers for Catherine Bond and Jane Pearce were held at St John the Baptist Church, Felixstowe, Suffolk. Both are associate priests in the parish and celebrated the “love and friendship” and “commitment to one another”. Blessing same-sex couples was sanctioned by the House of Bishops just days ago.   The vicar, Canon Andrew Dotchin, said the couple were continuing on a “pilgrimage graced by Your [God’s] blessing, with You as their companion in the dark where they can rejoice and hope in sustaining their love for all the days of their lives”. Catherine, wearing a mustard yellow jacket, and Jane, in a grey jacket, smiled as they stood in front of the congregation and received a round of applause initiated by the vicar.   The General Synod, known as the Church of England’s Parliament, of which Rev Dotchin is a member, voted in favour of offering blessings to same-sex couples in civil partnerships and marriages for the first time in February. It came after a near eight-hour debate over two days. The House of Bishops confirmed last Tuesday its decision to commend the prayers for use in regular public worship. There has been no legislative change in the Church and offering blessings, from yesterday, is a voluntary decision for clergy.
