 Not content with dragging its heels over sanctions and trying to give Putin a soft way out, it now decides not to give £42bn in aid that  Ukraine  desperately needs. And please don’t tell me that it’s not the EU, but Hungary, who’s made this decision. All for one, and one for all. That’s the EU way. It’s one of the big reasons Britain voted out. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, is a bit of a thug. Not only does he block aid to a fellow European country suffering genocide at the hands of Mr Putin, but he also introduces measures to undermine democracy, judicial independence and press freedom, and brings in laws to target LGBT people. But EU rules mean that whatever more enlightened states wish to do, they cannot unless he gives the nod. Ahh, they might say, but hasn’t the EU just voted to make  Ukraine  a member? Doesn’t that show that the EU cares about the future of that brave nation? Come off it.  Ukraine ’s EU accession might take decades. Certainly years. There are tons of hurdles to be overcome, and even then, there’s no guarantee of success. Orban (yup, him again) chose not to sit in the meeting where accession was discussed and has vowed to oppose it.   And in the meantime,  Ukraine , without that urgently needed aid, might not actually exist for much longer, despite the immense courage of its people. That’s certainly the intention of Putin, who regards the breakup of the Soviet Union as a tragedy to be reversed, and thinks that conquering  Ukraine  without any Ukrainians left, because they’ve all been driven away or killed, would be tickety-boo. Yet the EU’s de facto leader, Germany, in alliance with America, chooses this of all moments to go soft, and talks up the need for  Ukraine  to sign some sort of grubby peace deal, thereby rewarding Putin for his entirely unprovoked and murderous invasion. Putin must not be humiliated, they say. We need his oil too much, they add. The Ukrainians need to get real, they suggest. Well, thanks a million. And if Trump gets into power next year,  Ukraine ’s position will become even more precarious, with the NATO alliance under threat. So rather than going easy on Putin, like some cowered kid in the playground, now is the time for the whole of Europe to get serious about standing up to him. Otherwise,  Ukraine  will just be the start of Putin’s warmongering. Yet, tragically, the reverse is happening. By voting against aid to  Ukraine , while dangling the distant prospect of membership, the EU has chosen symbolism over substance. The UK, meanwhile, having Brexited, can do what’s right. Not only did we lead the way in offering unequivocal support to  Ukraine  in March 2022, send much needed weapons and military know-how to Kyiv when others refused, and head the charge for international sanctions, but just this week Lord Cameron has led calls for G7 confiscation of Russian assets, much to France’s and Germany’s irritation. The fact that Sadiq Khan, citing some absurd legal technicality, has chosen not to send Ulez-uncompliant vehicles to Kyiv that could have aided the war effort, is a disgusting exception that only proves the general rule: Britain has been  Ukraine ’s number one friend and ally. But there is only so much we alone can do, however much our efforts are valued in Kyiv. So, now is the time for the West to stand united, shoulder-to-shoulder, and defy Putin. It’s time for the EU to do the right thing by  Ukraine . It’s the least that brave nation deserves.
