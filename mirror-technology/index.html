Windows 10 update  ( Image: MICROSOFT) If like millions of others you don't want to ditch Windows 10 from your PC be warned. This ageing operating system (OS) will soon sent to the scrap heap and it could leave you facing new fees to continue using it safely. For those unaware, Windows 10's end of life will take place in 2025 which means Microsoft will no longer push out new features or vital security updates after that date.   With Windows 10 still the most popular OS on the planet, Microsoft is clearly worried that support coming to a close could leave millions at risk from cyber criminals who could take advantage of PCs not getting regular bug-fixing patches.   That's why the US firm says it will offer users the chance to carry in getting "Extended Security Updates" past the 2025 deadline. That's good news but it is going to cost you.   Microsoft has confirmed that those wanting to take advantage of ESUs will need to cough up a fee to take advantage.   "If you are an individual consumer or an organization who elects to continue using Windows 10 after support ends on October 14, 2025, you will have the option of enrolling your PC in the paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) program," Microsoft confirmed.   "The ESU program enables PCs to continue to receive Critical and Important security updates (as defined by the Microsoft Security Response Center) through an annual subscription service after support ends. More details including pricing will be provided at a later date."   Microsoft is still strongly recommending that users switch to Windows 11 but not all PCs are compatible with the firm's latest OS so those Extended Security Updates could offer a vital lifeline.   "While we strongly recommend moving to Windows 11, we understand there are circumstances that could prevent you from replacing Windows 10 devices before the EOS date. Therefore, Microsoft will offer Extended Security Updates," Microsoft's Jason Leznek.   Hopefully, Microsoft will reveal more news on how much things will cost in the coming months.
