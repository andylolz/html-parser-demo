An investigation by  Sheffield United  into the death of Maddy Cusack has found there was "no evidence of wrongdoing".   The 27-year-old, who tragically passed away back in September, was the Blades' longest serving player, becoming the first for the club to reach 100 appearances for their women's team. On September 20, Cusack was found dead at her home in Horsley, Derbyshire.   At the time, police said there was no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. The club then appointed an independent third party to lead an investigation into Cusack's death, and issues and concerns that had been raised by her family about internal conduct.

   A moving statement from Cusack's mother, Deborah, detailed how football broke the Blades' star's spirit. It read: " My beautiful daughter, Madeleine. The saddest and most utterly heart-breaking reason why I am having to stand here and speak to you today is because of football.   "From February this year, the indomitable, irrepressible spirit, the spirit called Maddy, the spirit that we had so fiercely protected, was allowed to be broken, taking her away from me."   Despite Cusack's mother stating that football broke the 27-year-old's spirit, Sheffield United have announced there was "no evidence of wrongdoing" at the club. A club statement read: "Following a thorough review of the valuable input provided by each of the key witnesses put forward by Maddy's family and the Club, the investigation has found no evidence of wrongdoing.

   "The Club is always looking for ways to evolve and will reflect on the outcomes and recommendations arising from the investigation to consider how processes and policies may be improved."   But while the Blades statement seemingly absolves them of any potential issue on their end into Cusack's death, what is true is that back in September, their women's first team manager, Jonathan Morgan, left the club after a formal complaint was lodged against him over his behaviour towards certain player.   However, the Mail report the investigation by the Blades into the complaints against Morgan is now over, meaning he can return to his post, with discussions set to continue in the coming weeks around if he will return in the New Year.
