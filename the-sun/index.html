 Opening the video, Frank said: "Here is an example of a gift that we may have gotten our children this  Christmas  that we should think about not letting our kids play with." 
 Frank explained that the gift is water beads which are small colourful balls made of superabsorbent polymers. 
 They are often sold in toys, as part of craft kits or as sensory toys for children with disabilities. 
 The lawyer said: "If they are ingested or inhaled they can get into the moisture that is naturally in our bodies and expand."

 He continued: "This expansion can cause obstruction in children's lungs or even their intestines". 
 The beads can also end up in people's ears and can cause damage or even hearing loss. 
 Frank added that there has been allegations of deaths and very serious injuries that have led to surgery caused by the children's toys. 
 "Be very careful with these water beads", Frank said. 
 Three major retailers,  Amazon ,  Target  and  Walmart  have said that they are suspending the sale of the toys, due to growing safety concerns. 
 According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, 7,800 water bead related injuries were treated in hospital emergency rooms between 2016 and 2022. 
 TikTok users raced to the video's comments section to share their thoughts on the dangerous toys. 
 One user said: "They're not allowed in my house". 
 Another user added: "Thank you for sharing, most people don't even think about that." 
 A third said: "My son got one stuck in his ear once. I'm never buying them again".
