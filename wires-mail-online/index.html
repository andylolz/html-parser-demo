  Dutch Schiphol airport plans 460,000 flights for 2024 -document   By  Reuters       Published:    14:45, 18 December 2023     |    Updated:    14:45, 18 December 2023          
     AMSTERDAM, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The owner of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has proposed accepting around 460,000 flights in 2024, fewer than the airline industry demands but more than environmentalist and residents' groups would like to see, according to a planning document seen by Reuters.   The number of flights at Schiphol, one of Europe's largest hubs, has been in doubt since the Dutch government in November was forced to scrap plans for a cap at 452,000 flights amid pressure from the airline industry, the United States and the European Union.   In a Royal Schiphol Group document seen by Reuters, the company said allowing 460,000 flights in 2024 was its "preferred scenario" and allowing more - up to 483,000 flights - would only be possible if airlines commit to altering schedules, but that it would increase the risk of logistics breakdowns similar to those suffered in 2022.   The airport said in emailed remarks to Reuters that it was still discussing options with airlines, the Dutch customs department and the Netherlands' air traffic control body.   "We are faced with a dilemma," a spokesperson said. "We understand the desire of airlines to fly more than the 460,000 flights".   However, the airport had faced operational challenges in 2023 carrying out around 435,000 flights.   The outgoing Dutch government has said it continues to believe the airport will need to shrink in order to meet environmental goals and reduce noise pollution.   However, it was unclear whether that will continue to be policy after right-wing parties that favor growth at Schiphol booked gains in   the Nov. 22 national election   .   Before the pandemic, Schiphol handled up to 500,000 flights. (Reporting by Toby Sterling, editing by Charlotte Van Campenhout, Tomasz Janowski and Bernadette Baum)
