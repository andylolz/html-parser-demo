Millions of older people in receipt of the  New or Basic State Pension  are set for another significant increase next year after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed that the Triple Lock policy will be honoured in full. This means that someone on the full New State Pension will see payments go up from £203.85 per week to £221.20 and as payments are typically made every four weeks, this amounts to £884.80 each pay period.  Over the 2024/25 financial year, this is an increase of £902, taking the annual income from  State Pension alone  from £10,600 to £11,502.    Similarly, someone on the full rate of the  Old or Basic State Pension  will see payments go up from £156.20 per week to £169.50 - this amounts to £678 each pay period. Over the 2024/25 financial year, this is an increase of £692, taking the annual income from £8,122 to £8,814.

     However,  pension consultants LCP  (Lane Clark & Peacock) have warned that the uprating could see more retirees dragged into the tax net for the 2024/25 financial year as the personal income threshold remains frozen at £12,570 and the full, New State Pension will be worth £11,502 - leaving just £1,068 before the limit is exceeded.    There is no automatic way of collecting the tax that pensioners might owe, because State Pensions are paid in full, before the deduction of tax. In such cases,  HM Revenue and Customs  (HMRC) could operate a system known as ‘simple assessment’.    Under ‘simple assessment’, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) would notify HMRC at the end of a tax year how much State Pension people have received. If this takes someone over the income tax threshold, there would be a tax bill to be paid.   LCP said HMRC may write to the pensioner after the end of the tax year telling them that they have not paid the tax due on their State Pension and requiring them to make a payment before January 31 the following year.   It warned that pensioners could have received - and spent - all of their pension during one financial year only to receive a tax bill on that pension the following year.   For pensioners who have a State Pension and a private pension, the state will collect any tax due through the code applied to the private pension.   The income tax threshold has been frozen at £12,570 since 2021/22. This could mean pensioners receiving over £242 per week would owe some income tax.   LCP said that online statistics from DWP indicate that, as at November 2020, over 2.3 million pensioners had a State Pension of £195 per week or more, and taking account of State Pension increases since then, these people would now have a pension over the tax threshold next year.   While some of these pensioners will have private pensions that can be used to collect any tax due, others will have large State Pensions precisely because they did not make alternative private provision, it said.   LCP estimates that around one in five of these pensioners, or more than 400,000 may have no other source of income from which HMRC can collect the tax owed.   This is the group who are now at risk of getting unexpected tax bills and may need to consider setting aside some of their state pension each month so that they have the funds available to pay a future tax bill, it said.

   Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at LCP said: “Millions of pensioners have been dragged into the tax net for the first time in recent years, primarily because of the multi-year freeze on tax thresholds.   “Many are now at risk of an unexpected letter from HMRC asking for tax they may not have realised was due. Any pensioner with a pension next year over £242 per week will have tax to pay, and if they do not have a private pension through which the tax can be collected, they may need to set some money aside for an unwelcome tax demand.”   LCP believes many of those who could be hit by unexpected bills could be receiving the old State Pension, having reached their State Pension age by 2016.
