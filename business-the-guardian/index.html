Adobe and Figma abandon $20bn merger after opposition from regulators An Adobe logo on a smartphone.  Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters Newsflash: Adobe’s $20bn deal to buy design software company Figma has dramatically collapsed, in the face of opposition from regulators. Adobe and Figma have mutually agreed to terminate the deal, which was announced on September 2022, after strugging to persuade regulators to approve the merger. They say that there is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. Last month, the CMA warned that the deal would harm competition in product design software by bringing two of the main companies in the sector together. The European Commission also told Adobe in November that it believed the proposed acquisition of Figma may reduce competition in the global markets for the supply of interactive product design software and of other creative design software. Shantanu   Narayen , chair and CEO of Adobe. says both companies “strongly disagree” with the regulators, but have decided it is best to move forward independently. Narayen  adds: 
 “While Adobe and Figma shared a vision to jointly redefine the future of creativity and productivity, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on our massive market opportunity and mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences.” 
 The companies have signed a termination agreement that resolves all outstanding matters from the transaction, including Adobe paying Figma a termination fee, thought to be $1bn. Figma produces a collaborative web application for interface design, allowing teams who are producing user interface and user experience design projects to collaborate together online. Back in September 2022, The Observer’s John Naughton wrote that the $20bn fee was “way above any rational valuation of Figma”. He compared the Adobe-Figma deal to Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 (which took out a potential competitor), adding that “The deal should be challenged, investigated and banned.” Key events Shares in  Adobe  have jumped by almost 2% in early US trading, following the cancellation of its $20bn deal to buy  Figma . That suggests investors thought Adobe was overpaying…. While one deal falls, another has been announced. Nippon   Steel  has reached a deal to acquire  US   Steel , the 122-year-old Pittsburgh steelmaker, in a $14.1bn deal. The price of $55 per share is a 40% premium to  US   Steel’s  closing price. Shares in  US   Steel  have jumped 26% to $49.50 at the start of trading in New York. US   Steel  launched a strategic review in August after receiving several unsolicited offers for a partial or total takeover of the company – that pushed its share price up from $22 to $30 last summer, before it kept climbing through the autumn. Dylan Field , co-founder and CEO of  Figma , says: 
 “While we’re disappointed in the outcome, I am deeply grateful to everyone who has contributed to this effort and excited to find other ways to innovate on behalf of our respective communities with Adobe.”

Moneyfacts  reports that: 
 The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.96%. This is down from an average rate of 5.98% on the previous working day.

 Here’s our news story on BP’s decision to halt all shipments of oil and gas through the Red Sea… BP temporarily pauses all transits through Red Sea BP Plc said it will pause all its oil tanker shipments through the Red Sea. The move follows an escalation of attacks on merchant shipping being mounted from Yemen’s ports by Houthi forces. In a statement, BP says: 
 “The safety and security of our people and those working on our behalf is BP’s priority. 
 “In light of the deteriorating security situation for shipping in the Red Sea, BP has decided to temporarily pause all transits through the Red Sea.” 
 It emerged over the weekend that the US is preparing to announce the launch of an expanded maritime protection force, to guard shipping in the Red Sea, which is a crucial routes for oil and fuel shipments. Some shipping firms, including Denmark’s  Maersk,  have alread paused journeys through the Red Sea until tensions in the Middle East fall. Hollywood Bowl says minimum wage rise may prompt higher prices Speaking of wage growth…. the head of bowling chain Hollywood Bowl has warned that the “quite painful” increase in the UK’s minimum wage may force it to raise prices. Hollywood Bowl CEO Stephen Burns told Radio 4’s Today Proogramme that the near 10% increase in the minimum wage was an “unexpected hit” for the business, as it had expected a smaller rise of around 7.7%. Burns said the new rate, which begins in April, was “quite painful”. It’s estimated to cost around £1.2m per year. He added: 
 “Clearly it’s put a bit of pressure on. 
 “We have managed to keep our prices pretty low to try and mitigate that but we may need to do something again towards the mid or the end of the year.” 
 From April, the minimum wage for workers over 23 will increase to £11.44 per hour next April, from £10.42. Broadbent: Too soon to say wage growth is slowing Just in: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent is hinting that the UK’s central bank needs to see a deeper slowdown in wage inflation before it can consider cutting interest rates. Broadbent  is giving a speech to the London Business School, outlining the challenge of settting monetary policy in a time of uncertainty. That uncertainty covers both the supply side of the economy, and the incoming data showing the state of the economy, Broadbent explains. And he singles out earnings growth as a key indicator, saying it is too soon to say that wage growth is slowing. Last week, the latest labour force data showed that wage growth including bonuses fell to 7.2% from 8%. Broadbent , though, says the Bank’s monetary policy committee will need to see a clearer fall, saying: 
 One current example is wage growth. 
 Given the volatility in the official estimates, and the disparity (such as it is) among the various indicators we have, it will probably require a more protracted and clearer decline in these series before the MPC can safely conclude that things are on a firmly downward trend. 
 In the bond market, UK government debt is strengthening as traders continue to anticipate Bank of England rate cuts next year. This has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK gilts, down to 4.13% from from 4.19% on Friday. Ten-year gilt yields have dropped to 3.65%, down from 3.7%, the lowest since mid-April. The deterioration in Ifo’s business sentiment index ( see last post ) suggests that recent fiscal woes are weighing on the German economy. Carsten   Brzeski , global head of macro at  ING , says the recession risk in Germany remains high, not only for 2023 but for 2024 as well. Brzeski  writes: 
 Today’s Ifo index reading brings the macro year for Germany almost to a close. 
 It has been another turbulent year in which the economy seems to have been in permanent crisis mode. Supply chain frictions resulting from the pandemic lockdowns and war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, surging inflation, tightening of monetary policy and several structural shortcomings - the list of crises and challenges facing the German economy is long. 
 This is why some take comfort in the fact that the economy is “only” stuck in stagnation and has avoided a more severe recession. And, indeed, things could have been worse. But this should be no reason for any complacency. 
 On the contrary, even if the worst of the weakening in sentiment seems to be behind us, the hard economic reality does not look pretty. In fact, the economy seems to be on track for another quarter of contraction in the final quarter of 2023 and even the start of 2024 does not yet look really promising. 
 Sentiment in German business has clouded over German business morale has worsened in December, according to the latest data from the Ifo institute. Ifo’s  business climate index, just released, shows that companies are less happy about current economic conditions, and also gloomier about the economy outlook. Ifo’s  current situation index has fallen to 88.5 from 89.4 in November, while its gauge of economic expectations declined to 84.3 in December from 85.1 in November. Ifo  says that “sentiment in German business has clouded over”. Within manufacturing,  Ifo  says order books are shrinking, while energy-intensive industries are having “a particularly tough time”. In the services sector, the business climate improved slightly, but future expectations in the restaurants and catering business “took a nosedive”. Ifo  president  Clemens   Fuest  says: 
 “As the year draws to a close, the German economy remains weak.” 
 A Warhammer store in London  Photograph: May James/Reuters Games Workshop, the tabletop gaming company, has reached an agreement with Amazon to develop its Warhammer 40,000 game into films and television series. Games Workshop  has told the City that it has granted  Amazon  exclusive rights to films and television series set within hit franchise Warhammer 40,000, the science-fiction fantasy miniature war game. Amazon  has also taken an option to license equivalent rights in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. Games   Workshop  says: 
 Games Workshop and Amazon will work together for a period of 12 months to agree creative guidelines for the films and television series to be developed by Amazon. 
 The agreement will only proceed once the creative guidelines are mutually agreed between Games Workshop and Amazon. 
 The deal comes a year after the two companies first struck a deal to develop  Games   Workshop’s  intellectual property into film and TV productions. Today’s agreement means  Games   Workshop  and  Amazon  will work together for 12 months to agree creative guidelines for the films and television series. It is not expected to have an immediate impact on  Games   Workshop’s  finances, as it is not making any change to its forecast for the current financial year. Shares in  Games   Workshop  are up 1.8% this morning. Analysts at investment bank  Jefferies  say: 
 A year after announcing its ‘agreement in principle’ with Amazon, GAW has today announced that the deal has been signed to develop 40k into films and TV series. 
 There will be a 12-month period to agree creative guidelines, but we had always anticipated an extended timeline (up to 3yrs) until 40k actually hits the screens. 
 Fundamentally, we think the deal offers substantial long-term upside for Warhammer to build its global brand exposure. 
 UK to introduce carbon levy on imports by 2027 The UK government has announced it will bring in a new import carbon pricing mechanism by 2027. Under the plan, goods imported from countries with a lower or no carbon price will incur a new levy. The new  carbon   border   adjustment   mechanism  ( CBAM ) is part of the UK’s decarbonisation efforts, and will effectively penalise overseas manufacturers who pay a smaller charge for carbon emissions than UK factories, or none at all. It will, the government hopes, avoid emissions being displaced from Britain to other countries which have a lower or no carbon price. Currently, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme puts a price on emitting a tonne of CO₂, similar to the European Union’s own carbon trading scheme. The  CBAM  will apply to carbon intensive products in the iron, steel, aluminium, fertiliser, hydrogen, ceramics, glass and cement sectors. Chancellor  Jeremy   Hunt  says: 
 “This levy will make sure carbon intensive products from overseas – like steel and ceramics – face a comparable carbon price to those produced in the UK, so that our decarbonisation efforts translate into reductions in global emissions. 
 “This should give UK industry the confidence to invest in decarbonisation as the world transitions to net zero.” 
 Earlier this month the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said putting an implicit price on carbon emissions would generate the vast amounts of cash needed to tackle the climate crisis. Asia-Pacific markets dip as US rate-cut hopes are dampened A currency trader gestures at the foreign exchange dealing room of the KEB Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, today.  Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP The path of interest rates next year will have a huge impact on economic growth, and the markets, in 2024. Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve sparked a share rally after appearing to signal that US interest rates have peaked. That cheered investors, who welcomed the suggestion that the Fed was looking forward to cutting US interest rates in coming months. But on Friday,  Federal   Reserve  Bank of New York President  John   Williams  pushed back against these expectations, insisting that “we aren’t really talking about rate cuts right now”. Williams’  comments lifted the dollar at the end of last week. And today, Asia-Pacific markets are in the red, as some of last week’s rate-cut exuberance deflates. China’s  Shenzhen   Composite  is down over 1%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng has lost 1% and Japan’s  Topix  is down 0.66%. Kyle   Rodda , senior financial market analyst at  capital.com,  explains: 
 The markets sobered up slightly at the end of the week as Fed speakers appeared to push back on the notion of rate cuts next year. The central bank wheeled out New York Fed head John Williams to clarify things, suggesting that the Fed “isn’t really talking about rate cuts” and tabling a March cut is premature. 
 The Fed’s use of Williams is telling because his commentary a few weeks ago about the case for lowering rates as inflation falls to keep real rates steady fuelled the euphoria about cuts. 
 The mixed messaging raises the question of whether the Fed has fumbled its communication and potentially scored an unfortunate own goal as financial conditions loosen as a result of the new forward guidance. 
 Introduction: UK economy limping along and 'vulnerable to shocks' Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s the start of the last working week before Christmas, and investors’ minds in the City are turning to 2024 (unless they’ve clocked off already). After a turbulent 2023, what will next year bring to the markets, and Britain’s economy, they ponder. Well, according to  KPMG , Britain’s growth in 2024 will be modest, at best. The accountancy giant’s latest global economic outlook, released this morning, cautions that the UK economy is “limping with a sprained ankle”, at at time when global growth is being held back by high interest rates and policy uncertainty. KPMG  estimates UK GDP will rise by 0.5% in 2024, the same as in 2023, picking up to 1% in 2025. UK GDP forecasts  Photograph: KPMG That’s a small upgrade on their old forecasts, of 0.4% growth in 2023 and 0.3% in 2024. And it’s more optimistic than the Bank of England, which projects zero growth next year. But it’s still a weak prospect, partly due to high borrowing costs. Even though UK interest rates have been stuck at 5.25% since August, much of the impact is yet to be felt as many households have yet to roll onto new, pricier, mortgage deals. KPMG  explain: 
 Mortgage rates on new loans have risen by 370 basis points since the end of 2021, reflecting higher policy rates. However, the effective rate on the stock of mortgages has only increased by around 120 basis points, as a large share of mortgages with repayments fixed up to five years has been insulated from the immediate impact of higher rates. 
  Photograph: KPMG UK unemployment is tipped to rise, from 4.1% this year to 4.7% in 2024, and 4.9% in 2025. Yael Selfin,  chief economist at  KPMG   UK , says: 
 “While the UK economy is resilient, it needs to get its mojo back. We expect monetary and fiscal policies to act as a headwind to growth over the next two years, and a sudden revival in productivity is not likely to come to the rescue. 
 This means that even the expected continuation of positive growth should not be celebrated prematurely, as the outlook is dominated by downside risks.” 
 Looking globally,  KPMG  predicts global GDP growth of 2.2% in 2024 – down from 2.6% in 2023, with a return to 2.6% growth anticipated in 2025. Here are the key points from the report: 
 Activity has outperformed expectations, but the UK economy remains weak and vulnerable to shocks. 
 Risks to the UK outlook are skewed to the downside, and stem from a more persistent inflation, delayed impact of monetary policy, and structural weakness of labour supply. 
 Deceleration in growth in some of the world’s largest economies, coupled with little impetus elsewhere, could see global GDP growth easing slightly in 2024. 
 Weaker momentum should help push down inflation, with average world inflation expected to halve by 2025. 
 Also coming up We’ll hear from Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent this morning, when he gives a speech at London Business School. Last week,  the BoE warned that fighting inflation was tougher in the UK than in the eurozone and US . On the economics front, the latest German IFO business survey will test the temperature of Europe’s largest economy,  as it struggles towards 2024 . Michael Hewson , chief market analyst at  CMC   Markets   UK , says: 
 Given the weak nature of last week’s PMI numbers it would be surprising to see a significant improvement on the November numbers when the current assessment improved slightly to 89.4.
