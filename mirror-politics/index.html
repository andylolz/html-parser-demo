Tory MP hints RAF could help solve Rwanda plane crisis but says 'money talks' Brendan Clarke-Smith said ministers can 'always rely' on the RAF amid reports commercial airlines are 'running a mile' from the Rwanda deportation scheme The Home Office is reportedly struggling to find airlines willing to get involved in the Rwanda scheme  ( Image: PA) A Tory MP says the RAF could step in and carry out Rwanda deportation flights if commercial firms refuse - but added that "money talks".   The Home Office is reportedly struggling to find airlines willing to help, meaning that even if the controversial scheme does get the go-ahead, it will have no planes. Frustrated officials say companies won't sign contracts because of the damage it will do to their reputation.    It is a fresh blow to  Rishi Sunak  as he desperately tries to get the costly scheme off the ground. But Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he believes airlines will come onboard as "money talks". But if they don't, he added, the RAF could bail the Government out.    He told GB News: "Nearer the time money talks at the end of the day, I'm sure there will be plenty of commercial partners who will be interested. And if they're not we've got our own planes and we're going to do it anyway."   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Brendan Clarke Smith said the RAF could help if needed 
 
    Quizzed about the RAF using its planes to operate the heavily-criticised scheme - diverting them away from other duties - Mr Clarke-Smith said: "I'm sure they'll be able to if they're actually called upon, you can always rely on the RAF.    "But they're very busy people they've got other things to do, we've got the war in  Ukraine  going on, we've got things in Israel going on, they've got their own job to do. We want the Home Office to be able to manage this and that's why they're trying to find contractors to do it."    He hit out at companies who refused to get involved, stating: "There's lots of ifs and buts and woke capitalism as it is nowadays and people's brand, I think people will be going back to those airlines and saying we want to stop seeing deaths in the Channel, deaths at sea, what are you doing about that? I think it works that way and we should bear that in mind."    According to the Sunday Times, Government insiders fear they will have to get the  Ministry of Defence  involved as companies "run a mile". A source told the newspaper: “It’s unbelievable. We’ve given £100 million to the Rwandan government for a Rwanda scheme and yet we have no planes to get people to Rwanda.”   But there are questions over whether RAF chiefs would agree to get involved. When the Government mooted a plan to send migrants to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic last year, an insider  told The Mirror : "The RAF will want nothing to do with it.”   Commercial airlines are usually used for deportation flights as they are much cheaper than RAF aircraft. In order to use military planes for Rwanda, the Home Office would need to lodge a formal request for military assistance, under the Military Aid to the Civil Authorities process. But that could line up another potential row between the Home Office and  Ministry of Defence , particularly given the volatile conflicts happening now.   So far no asylum flights have taken off from the UK to Rwanda since an agreement between the two countries was reached last April. A plane was stopped at the 11th hour in June last year due to legal challenges.   It is the latest snag in the long-running soap opera around the policy, which has been dismissed as a "grubby cash for humans" deal by human rights group. So far the Government has handed over £240million to the Rwandan Government, with further annual payments - thought to be £50million - also agreed.   Mr Sunak last week faced down a rebellion from right-wingers who want his Safety of Rwanda Bill beefed up. But members of the "five families" - a coalition of factions including the European Research Group (ERG) and the New Conservatives - are set to wrestle with ministers in the New Year, setting up a further headache for the PM.   The Supreme Court last month ruled the project - which will see asylum seekers sent to Rwanda in a desperate bid to stop small boat crossings - is illegal.    A Home Office spokeswoman said: “The government is committed to doing whatever it takes to stop the boats and get flights to Rwanda off the ground as soon as possible. Rwanda is ready to welcome large numbers of people, and we have robust plans in place for future flights following discussions with a range of companies.”
