  The distinctive building at the Bain Street entrance to the famous market will be repaired and retrofitted to bring it up to standards for the 21st century.
 
 
  The developers said the old Pipe Factory will be turned into a “hub for enterprise with a focus on  education , creativity, and pathways to employment”.
 
 
  O’DonnellBrown Architects has received planning and listed building consent from Glasgow City  Council  for their refurbishment of the old building.
 
 
  The only change to the outside is an external lift shaft, which will have a “decorative brickwork skin” to complement the surrounding architecture.
 
 
 
 
 
  The B-listed building has been owned by Friends of The Pipe Factory.
 
 
  It will be converted into office and workspace with firms ready to move in.
 
 
  The Friends of The Pipe Factory, Strangefield, INCH Architecture+Design and others will occupy the new space.
 
 
   A new front door on Moncur Street will be the main access point.
 
 
  Felix Wight, Director, Friends of The Pipe Factory, said: “This is an important milestone on our journey to bring back to life the Pipe Factory and ensure it becomes a pivotal community hub in Calton.”
 
 
  The pipe factory was purpose built in 1876-7 and after it stopped being used for the original purpose has had various uses.
 
 
  The architects plan on keeping the original character, retaining exposed brickwork, columns and beams with new modern insulation added and windows and floors upgraded.
 
 
 
 
 
  Sam Brown, Director, O’DonnellBrown, said: “We are honoured to be working on the project, which is a pivotal project for the regeneration of The Barras.
 
 
  “We are passionate about sustaining The Pipe Factory as a space for creative practice. This project embodies all that is good about how retrofit schemes can and should be taken forward where possible. This is an opportunity to deliver an exemplar scheme, providing a template for future retrofit projects.”
