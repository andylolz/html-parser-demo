 Israel will “fuel the conflict for another 50 years”, warns Wallace 
 “Israel risks losing legal authority for its war in Gaza by going on a crude and indiscriminate “killing rage” against the Palestinian people, Ben Wallace warns today. The former defence secretary warns the country’s tactics will “fuel the conflict for another 50 years” and will radicalise young Muslims across the world. His comments, made in an article for the Daily Telegraph, come amid a shift in tone from Britain and the West toward Israel as the death toll in Gaza spirals. Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, joined with his German counterpart to call for a “sustainable ceasefire” in the territory, adding that “too many civilians have been killed”. –  Daily Telegraph

 Jenrick: Ministers must cure the moral rot of anti-Semitism infecting universities 
 “The day Hamas inflicted the most deadly attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust was a litmus test for public decency in this country. While high-profile politicians of all stripes united in strong public condemnation of the attack and support for the Jewish community, this masked the extent of the moral decay from considerable sections of the public. Within a week there was a 1,200 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents. As we have come to expect, a convoy of cars soon took to the streets at night with the specific intent to intimidate onlookers. Even today, physical attacks on Jewish businesses, synagogues, schools and Jewish people persist. In the face of the worst outpouring of racism on the streets of the UK in decades there has been near-silence from the usual anti-racist campaigners.” –  Daily Telegraph 
 BBC attacked by Tories for branding Sunak-Meloni festival a ‘far-Right rally’ 
 “The BBC has been attacked by the Tories for describing a political festival attended by Rishi Sunak as a “far-Right rally”. The broadcaster is facing a fresh impartiality row for “happily” using the phrase to characterise the summit while refusing to call Hamas terrorists. The Prime Minister spoke at the four-day event on Saturday, hosted by his Italian counterpart and close ally Giorgia Meloni and attended by a wide range of Right-wing politicians. He used the platform to warn hostile states will increasingly “drive people to our shores” to destabilise Western nations unless leaders crack down on illegal migration and revamp asylum conventions.” –  Daily Telegraph 
 UK will stand up to enemies behind hybrid warfare and smash small boat gangs, vows Shapps 
 “Britain must “stand strong” against enemy states using mass migration as a form of hybrid warfare, Grant Shapps has declared. He insisted the UK must be willing to lead an “international conversation” on reforming global asylum rules to give Europe the best chance of destroying the people smugglers’ business models. Mr Shapps said: “We are working tirelessly to battle malign influences around the world, and that includes hostile states who are trying to use migration as a weapon. The Defence Secretary said Russia has used the tactic “as a means of war” to destabilise Western democracies.” –  Daily Express

 Top official ‘said Mones could buy off inquiry’ 
 “Baroness Mone’s husband has claimed that a senior government official invited him to pay money to make a criminal fraud investigation into PPE contracts “go away”. PPE Medpro, led by Doug Barrowman, made a £60 million profit after his offer to supply gowns and masks at the height of the pandemic was fast-tracked by his wife’s contacts. Yesterday Mone admitted lying when she claimed over many months that she was not involved in the lucrative deals and did not stand to gain when about half the profits were placed in a family trust. “I’m his wife, so I’m a beneficiary, as well as his children, as well as my children,” the Conservative peer and former underwear tycoon said.” –  The Times 
 Moderate Conservatives rally to challenge ‘extremists’ 
 “Tory moderates are fighting to revive the party’s centre after warning that the chances of it falling into the hands of “extremists” after the election are on a “knife edge”. More than 20 MPs, nearly half of them former ministers, have formed a pact to push liberal policies next year and beyond. Figures from across the Conservative Party are already wondering what will happen after an election — due by January 2025 — that the Tories are expected to lose. Some predict a lurch to the right with those on that wing already “pretty loud” in a “volatile” landscape.” –  The Times

 Sunak accidentally ended a notorious Westminster feud and it’s very bad news for him 
 “Mark Francois’s middle name is Gino, a gift from his Italian mother to represent his family heritage. So, it is little wonder he is revelling in his new role as a “mafia boss” of the right helping to bring together the so-called “Five Families”. But what should worry Rishi Sunak is that in this season of goodwill he has managed to create an alliance between Francois and the other main “Godfather” of the Tory right and end a feud between the two which had aided his rise to power. Perhaps the most surprising picture of the last week was that of Francois and Common Sense Group founder and chairman Sir John Hayes stand shoulder to shoulder in front of the cameras as they gave Sunak an offer he cannot refuse on the Rwanda Bill ahead of the Second Reading vote.” –  Daily Express 
 Government says schools ‘do not have duty’ to let children change gender identity 
 “Schools will be told that they do not have a “duty” to allow children to change their gender identity in new government guidance that will be published this week. On Tuesday ministers will set out how teachers and school leaders should address the issue after months of internal rows. The government had considered an outright ban on social transitioning, under which children can change their names, pronouns and uniforms. However, Victoria Prentis, the attorney-general, advised that such an approach would be unlawful under the Equality Act and would require new legislation. As a compromise the new guidance is explicit that schools are under no “general duty” or obligation to allow children to socially transition.” –  The Times

 Top Tories’ Rwanda links raise questions over its selection as UK asylum partner 
 “The new Illegal Immigration Minister in charge of the Government’s deal with Rwanda has a connection to the East African country that goes back more than a decade, i can reveal. Michael Tomlinson is the latest in a growing list of senior Conservatives closely involved in handling the Rwanda asylum partnership as ministers who, it has emerged, travelled to Kigali to volunteer in a scheme set up by the Tory party in the late 2000s. The news has led to renewed questions about why Rwanda – a country that the UK Supreme Court and Foreign Office have both declared unsuitable due to safety and human rights concerns – was selected by Tory ministers as the UK’s asylum “partner”. –  the i

 Labour candidate’s hypocrisy is typical of Starmer’s endless game-playing on migration –  Editorial, The Sun 
 
 >Today: 
 Labour 1) Scans and operations at weekends under Labour NHS plan 
 “Hospital scans and operations will be carried out at weekends and evenings under Labour plans to get the NHS “working around the clock”. Doctors will be paid overtime to work the extra hours under the plan announced by Sir Keir Starmer to clear the backlog, to be funded by abolishing non-dom tax status. Two million extra operations and scans will be completed under the seven-day NHS scheme, according to Labour, making a significant dent in the 7.71 million waiting list. The number of procedures currently being carried out by NHS staff nosedives by almost 80 per cent at the weekend, analysis by Labour shows.” –  Daily Telegraph 
 Labour 2) Business charm offensive ‘masks Labour’s lack of experience’ 
 “Just one of the candidates selected to fight Labour’s most winnable 100 constituencies works for a company listed on the London Stock Exchange. Analysis of Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidates by Apella Advisors, a strategic communications and public affairs consultancy, has laid bare the lack of business experience among those most likely to be elected as new MPs. With Labour more than 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, business leaders have been taking the party more seriously and scrutinising its policies. But the latest research will reignite fears about the lack of business experience among Labour MPs and within parliament more widely.” –  The Times

 Spiking crackdown to see more funding for test kits 
 “More training for door staff and funding for testing kits are among a package of measures announced to crackdown on spiking. The Home Office has said the law will also be “modernised” to make it clear spiking – putting alcohol or drugs into another person’s drink or body without their consent – is a crime. The plans have broadly been welcomed by campaigners. But they stop short of calls from some to make spiking a specific offence. Home Secretary James Cleverly said: “Spiking is a perverse crime which can have a lasting impact on victims. Our comprehensive new measures are designed to help police and staff in bars, restaurants, pubs and other premises to protect victims and bring more offenders to justice.” –  BBC News 
 Legal action planned over UK’s ‘cruel’ income threshold visa rules 
 Multinational families threatened with division or exile by tough new income thresholds for living together in the UK are planning legal action to overturn the “cruel and inhumane” policy. Thousands of families with one British partner and one born abroad will be hit by the government’s announcement that from next spring, only people earning £38,700 will be allowed to bring family members to join them – up from £18,600. Many may be forced either to live separately or to leave Britain to be together.” –  The Guardian
