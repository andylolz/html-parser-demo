Telecoms providers have been forced to pause plans to impose digital phone lines on vulnerable customers after reports of pensioners left unable to call for help during power cuts. Companies including BT and  Virgin Media  have been forced by Michelle Donelan, the technology secretary, to sign a charter to safeguard at-risk households during the nationwide switchover from analogue to internet-based landlines. Digital phones are not compatible with some “telecare” panic buttons and don’t function during power outages. However, critics have condemned the action as too little and too late and urged the government to delay the switch-off of analogue services planned for December 2024. Last month, the Guardian  reported on concerns  that the digitalisation of the telecoms network was moving too fast and too soon and could leave vulnerable users cut off. John Whittingdale, the minister for digital infrastructure, last week informed parliament of “serious incidents” of telecare devices failing in emergencies. Telecoms companies, including  BT  and Virgin Media, were summoned to a meeting with government officials following the reports. They have since pledged not to switch households to digital phone lines without ensuring their medical devices will continue to work. Donelan said: “The recent issues families have had to endure are unacceptable, and today’s agreements will help to protect consumers in future.” However, campaigners claim that vulnerable households will continue to be put at risk unless the analogue switch-off is delayed. “It seems the whole project is being completely botched,” said Dennis Reed, the director of the campaign group Silver Voices, which accuses BT of reneging on earlier promises not to force over-70s to switch. “BT paused the rollout in 2022 after customers were unable to call 999 during storms, then resumed last year even though nothing had changed. I’m sceptical that telecoms firms will do as they say. We want the government to extend the rollout deadline by at least five years so all these problems can be ironed out.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
